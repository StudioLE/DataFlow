# StudioLE.DataFlow

This project is a sandbox for experimenting with DataFlow pipelines in C# based on the implementation set out in [this article](https://michaelscodingspot.com/pipeline-pattern-tpl-dataflow/).

If you're looking for an actual DataFlow library you should probably look elsewhere.

## Contributing

The `master` branch is protected to ensure the commit history is clean and linear.
- Contributions should be made to a new branch and a pull request created.
- Pull request checks must pass before merging. 
- If changes are minimal, merge should be by `squash`.
- Otherwise, merge by `rebase` (learn more about [Merging vs. Rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)).
- Never, use merge commit.
